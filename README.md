# 🧠 N33tcode 150: Master the Art of Problem Solving in Python! 💻

Welcome to **N33tcode-150**, a journey to master problem-solving by tackling 150 curated coding challenges, all in **Python**! 🚀

> _"Every billion-dollar value starts with 0."_ — The path to becoming a great problem solver starts with a single problem. Let's conquer them one by one! 💡

## Why N33tcode 150?

Our goal is simple: to equip you with the skills needed to solve real-world coding challenges using **Python**. We’ll cover almost every major topic in problem-solving, including:
- **Arrays & Strings** 🧵
- **Recursion & Backtracking** 🔁
- **Dynamic Programming** 📊
- **Linked Lists, Trees, & Graphs** 🌳
- **Searching & Sorting Algorithms** 🔍
- **Hash Maps & Sets** 🔑
- **Mathematical Problems** ➕➖
- **Greedy & Divide-and-Conquer Techniques** 🍴

Whether you're prepping for technical interviews or just looking to improve, this is the place for you!

## How It Works

1. **Fork the Repository**: Start by forking this repo to your GitHub account. [Fork Here](https://github.com/cyber-bytezz/N33tcode-150).
   
2. **Create a Branch**: Name your branch after yourself in your forked repository.

3. **Solve One Problem Per Day**: We'll solve **one problem a day** from the list, with each problem designed to challenge and improve your understanding of algorithms and data structures.

4. **Commit Your Solutions**: Submit your solutions by **8 PM daily**.

5. **Stay Consistent**: Commitment is key! The Auto-Tracking Bot will monitor activity, and inactive participants may be removed.

## Topics We Will Cover 🏆
We’re tackling an extensive range of coding topics to build a strong foundation for your problem-solving abilities:
- Data Structures (Arrays, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs)
- Algorithms (Sorting, Searching, Dynamic Programming, Recursion)
- Optimization and Time Complexity
- String Manipulation
- Mathematical Problems and Bit Manipulation

## Daily Commitment: One Problem a Day 💪
Consistency is what separates good developers from great developers. By solving one problem every day, you’ll build long-lasting skills that will help you in interviews, projects, and real-world problem-solving.

### Rules:
- Fork the repository.
- Create a branch named after yourself.
- Solve the daily problem and commit the solution to your branch.
- **Miss a day?** You’ll be tracked and might get removed by the Auto-Tracking Bot.
